   abstract = {Undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes has become a common condition in the US, comprising one-third of all cases of the disease. We believe that screening for and detection of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes is an important endeavor. In this review we provide evidence that diabetes is a condition that is appropriate for population screening and detection. This includes evidence that: 1. Type 2 diabetes is a significant health problem. It affects more than 16 million adults in the US and places these individuals at high risk for serious complications of the eyes, nerves, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. 2. There is a latent phase before diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. During this period of undiagnosed disease, risk factors for diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications are markedly elevated and diabetic complications are developing. 3. Diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been established and are based on plasma glucose values. These criteria define a group of individuals with significant hyperglycemia who also have a high frequency of risk factors for micro- and macrovascular disease. 4. The natural history of Type 2 diabetes is understood. In most patients, diabetes proceeds inexorably from genetic predisposition, through the stage of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, to beta cell failure and overt clinical disease. 5. There are effective and acceptable therapies available for Type 2 diabetes and its complications. Treating hyperglycemia to prevent complications is more effective than treating these complications after they have developed. Furthermore, guidelines for treatment to prevent cardiovascular disease in people known to have diabetes are more stringent than in those individuals who are not known to have diabetes. 6. There is a suitable test for screening for undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes that has high sensitivity and specificity - measurement of fasting plasma glucose. Guidelines for identifying persons at high risk for diabetes have been established.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal stem cell disorder accounting for 15% of adult leukemias. We aimed to determine if machine learning models could predict CML using blood cell counts prior to diagnosis. METHODS: We identified patients with a diagnostic test for CML (BCR-ABL1) and at least 6 consecutive prior years of differential blood cell counts between 1999 and 2020 in the largest integrated health care system in the United States. Blood cell counts from different time periods prior to CML diagnostic testing were used to train, validate, and test machine learning models. RESULTS: The sample included 1,623 patients with BCR-ABL1 positivity rate 6.2%. The predictive ability of machine learning models improved when trained with blood cell counts closer to time of diagnosis: 2 to 5 years area under the curve (AUC), 0.59 to 0.67, 0.5 to 1 years AUC, 0.75 to 0.80, at diagnosis AUC, 0.87 to 0.92. CONCLUSIONS: Blood cell counts collected up to 5 years prior to diagnostic workup of CML successfully predicted the BCR-ABL1 test result. These findings suggest a machine learning model trained with blood cell counts could lead to diagnosis of CML earlier in the disease course compared to usual medical care.},

   abstract = {The rising burden of type 2 diabetes is a major concern in healthcare worldwide. This research aimed to analyze the global epidemiology of type 2 diabetes. We analyzed the incidence, prevalence, and burden of suffering of diabetes mellitus based on epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) current dataset from the Institute of Health Metrics, Seattle. Global and regional trends from 1990 to 2017 of type 2 diabetes for all ages were compiled. Forecast estimates were obtained using the SPSS Time Series Modeler. In 2017, approximately 462 million individuals were affected by type 2 diabetes corresponding to 6.28% of the world's population (4.4% of those aged 15-49 years, 15% of those aged 50-69, and 22% of those aged 70+), or a prevalence rate of 6059 cases per 100,000. Over 1 million deaths per year can be attributed to diabetes alone, making it the ninth leading cause of mortality. The burden of diabetes mellitus is rising globally, and at a much faster rate in developed regions, such as Western Europe. The gender distribution is equal, and the incidence peaks at around 55 years of age. Global prevalence of type 2 diabetes is projected to increase to 7079 individuals per 100,000 by 2030, reflecting a continued rise across all regions of the world. There are concerning trends of rising prevalence in lower-income countries. Urgent public health and clinical preventive measures are warranted.},

   abstract = {Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM2) includes a continuum of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that causes several chronic long-term complications such as coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The hair follicle could reveal signs of early vascular impairment, yet its relationship to early metabolic injuries has been largely ignored. We propose that in earlier stages of the continuum of DM2-related metabolic disorders, a group of susceptible patients who do not yet meet the diagnostic criteria to be considered as persons with DM2 may present chronic vascular impairment and end organ damage, including hair follicle damage, which can be evaluated to identify an early risk marker. This hypothesis is based in the association found between insulin resistance and alopecia in non-diabetic persons, and the hair loss on the lower limbs as a manifestation of long-term peripheral arterial disease among subjects with DM2. In order to test this hypothesis, studies are required to evaluate if hair follicle characteristics are related to and can predict hyperglycemic complications, and if they do so, which feature of the hair follicle, such as hair growth, best characterizes such DM2-related conditions. If this hypothesis were proven to be true, significant advances towards a personalized approach for early prevention strategies and management of DM2 would be made. By focusing on the hair follicles, early stages of metabolic-related organ damage could be identified using non-invasive low-cost techniques. In so doing, this approach could provide early identification of DM2-susceptible individuals and lead to the early initiation of adequate primary prevention strategies to reduce or avoid the onset of large internal organ damage.},
